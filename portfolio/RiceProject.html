  <h1 class = "box">RICE Quality Detection- (2016)</h1>
  </br>
  <div style="font-family:Open Sans">
  In agricultural industries, grain quality evaluation is a very big challenge. Quality control is very important in the food industry because after harvesting, based on the quality parameter, food products are classified and graded into different grades. Grain quality evaluation is done manually but it is relatively time-consuming, maybe varying results and costly. To overcome these limitations, Automated Processing Techniques is an alternative solution that can be used for grain quality analysis.
  </div></br>
  <div style ="font-family:Open Sans">
  We worked on rice in this project, as it is one of the agricultural products which requires intensive pre-processing before being sent to the market.
In this project, techniques which include detection of grain size and colour are elaborated upon. For grain size, the preferred algorithm is edge detection and for colour detection, which is also known as chalkiness or the opaque white region on the rice endosperm, multiple thresholding. The database referred to for this project was locally collected. It included rice sample images of various types (size etc) under various lighting conditions and orientation.
</br>
The block diagram below explains the stages of the project
</br>
- A camera was used to capture the image of the sample rice as an input to the system. The input sample image then undergoes a series of extraction and segmentation operations to get the ultimate binary image with the relevant objects (rice kernels). Using image processing techniques, further attributes of interest are extracted, such as length and breadth ratio, the chalkiness degree etc. With the help of an available database, we compare and finalize upon the grading of the rice-based on quality.
</br>
<div class="box">

</br>
Through a systemic approach towards improving the efficiency of detecting rice quality, the aim of this project was to select rice of the optimum quality. The main benefit of the proposed system was that it requires minimum time and cost and gives better results as compared to manual and other traditional methods.
The idea based on the core promises a revolution in the food industry and also to enhance food quality.
