  <div>
  </br>
  <p style="font-family: Open Sans, serif">
    This usability study was planned and conducted to support the modernization efforts of a video player. This video player supported the data collected my camera’s installed in the truck, which recorded the truck driver facing movements and road facing movements.  
    The recorded video was used as a part of driver coaching, safety, and compliance and if need be proof for insurance and court cases (in case of accidents and/or road rage). 
    </p>
  <p style="font-family: Open Sans, serif">
        The design and development effort were to move the application from legacy system to a modern application. With that, there were significant changes in overall look and feel of the application. Through my research, I was able to identify-
        1)	the features that are accepted well by the customers
        2)	the pain-points that users were experiencing 
        3)	user’s mental modal while preforming the give task 
  </p>

  <div>
  <h2>Research Goals</h2>
  </div>
  <div>
      <ul>To test the usability of modern application</ul>
      <ul>To understand and analyze the pain points.</ul>
      <ul>To understand if users can map and match between old application and new application </ul>
  </div>
  </br>
  </p>
  <div style = "font-family:Playfair Display">
  <h2>Step - 1 Usability Testing Set-up</h2></div>
  <div style="font-family: Open Sans">
		<p>This research was conducted remotely over Zoom with the customers who have used or are 
            using our legacy application. The research was primarily based on the concept of usability testing. 
            To meet the goals of this study I had collected qualitative data. 
        </p>
        <p>
        </br>
            All the participants were emailed a document with a list of 20 questions, broadly divided into two parts (focusing on two different screens). This test was performed on QA environment and the participants could access the 
            application on moderator’s screen via remote screenshare and access.
        </p>

    <h2>Step - 2 Synthesis and working with the data:</h2></div>
    <div style="font-family: Open Sans">
          <p> Synthesis, in Human-Centered Design, is a collaborative process of sensemaking, which leads to creating a coherent summary of all the 
              data gathered during the design research. 
            For this study, I used <b>behavioral coding</b> method to analyze the qualitative data. 
            Each participant’s research interview was coded, and time stamped. All the participants data was then categorized into “UX Positives”, “UX Issues”, “Design Ideas” & “User’s mental modals” to get results as per the set goals. The data was further categorized as per the ratio of user’s who has similar feedback.   
          </p>
        </br>
          <p>
            I also used an affinity mapping method to find patterns in my observations and group them. 
            I watched each screen recordings and recorded the insights on Miro using sticky notes on it. 
            I segmented each user into different columns, then I wrote down the major pain points on a sticky note. 
            Each task was a Venn diagram represented as UX Issue, UX positive and Design ideas. 
          </p>

  <div style = "font-family:Playfair Display">
    <h2>Step - 3 Findings</h2></div>
    <div style="font-family: Open Sans">
          <p> Based on the research results I could direct teams focus on 4 important features to iterate on. 
              </p>
        </br>
          <p>
            The research results also validated the designs which were working well and guided users finish their task
            </p>    
  </div></br>
  <div style = "font-family:Playfair Display">
    <h2>Step - 4 Presenting the results</h2></div>
    <div style="font-family: Open Sans">
          <p> These results were presented to designer and product manager’s and were replicated in an 
              excel sheet to further track the development, design and business process on the user feedback collected.  
              </p>

    <h2>Summary</h2></div>
    <div style="font-family: Open Sans">
          <p> 
            Through this case study, I learned the value of the user experience research process on Q. 
            I understood the needs of the users through the survey and conversations which gave me an in-depth insight into the pain points. 
            Through my research, I was able to identify-
          </p>
          <div>
              <ul>1) the features that are accepted well by the customers</ul>
              <ul>2) the pain-points that users were experiencing </ul>
              <ul>3) 3)	user’s mental modal while preforming the give task </ul>
